Hi! My name is Edmundo, I'm a mechanical engineer, starting to learn about programming. I'll be posting little projects like this to try my hand at python. All feedback, suggestions and ideas are welcome, please send them to https://www.reddit.com/user/ed_tucumonkey

PD: I don't really know how to upload the jupyter notebook so that it is readable and editable. Just getting started with github as well. So I uploaded both the full notebook and the raw python code in one cell, let me know if thatÂ´s ok or how should I do it. Thx
